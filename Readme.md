## Chatbot with LangChain, Ollama, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed with LangChain, Ollama, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging LLaMA 2 as the primary language model. It is capable of providing accurate, context-aware responses and real-time interactions.

# Features
● Conversational AI: Uses LLaMA 2 for natural language understanding and generation, providing a smooth and interactive experience.
● Dynamic Prompt Management: Integrated LangChain to handle complex prompt chaining, context preservation, and multi-step conversation flow.
● Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances the chatbot’s accuracy by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating responses.
● Scalable Deployment: Deployed using Ollama to manage model access, ensuring low-latency responses and efficient scaling.
# Technologies Used
● LLaMA 2: Advanced language model for generating human-like text.
● LangChain: Framework for managing prompts and creating conversational agents.
● Ollama: Deployment solution for efficient model access and scalability.
● Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combines retrieval-based methods with generation for accurate response generation.
